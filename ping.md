# ping
The easiest tool to test internet network connections is ping. 
It uses the ICMP protocol’s ECHO_REQUEST datagram to obtain an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from a remote host. 
The Ping command is integrated into all versions of Windows, so all you need to do to start using it is open up your command prompt or application.

To troubleshoot using ping, first, run it on your own network (the local host) to ensure that your internet network interface works. 
This is as easy as opening up the command prompt and typing “ping www.google.com”. 
Then, as you troubleshoot, you can ping hosts and gateways further and further in the network to try and diagnose the location of connectivity problems.

When you ping, you get information back, including the percentage of lost packets and average round-trip latency.
