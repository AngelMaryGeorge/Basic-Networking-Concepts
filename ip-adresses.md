# IP Address
## What is an IP Address?
The IP address stands for Internet Protocol address is also called IP number or internet address.
An IP address is a numerical label assigned to the devices connected to a computer network that uses the IP for communication. 
IP address act as an identifier for a specific machine on a particular network. 
It also helps you to develop a virtual connection between a destination and a source.

## Types of IP address

### Public IP Addresses
A public IP address is an address where one primary address is associated with your whole network.
In this type of IP address, each of the connected devices has the same IP address.
This type of public IP address is provided to your router by your ISP.

### Private IP Addresses
A private IP address is a unique IP number assigned to every device that connects to your home internet network, which includes devices like computers, tablets, smartphones, which is used in your household.
It also likely includes all types of Bluetooth devices you use, like printers or printers, smart devices like TV, etc. 
With a rising industry of internet of things (IoT) products, the number of private IP addresses you are likely to have in your own home is growing.

### Dynamic IP address
Dynamic IP addresses always keep changing. 
It is temporary and are allocated to a device every time it connects to the web. 
Dynamic IPs can trace their origin to a collection of IP addresses that are shared across many computers.
Dynamic IP addresses are another important type of internet protocol addresses. 
It is active for a specific amount of time; after that, it will expire.

### Static IP Addresses
A static IP address is an IP address that cannot be changed. 
In contrast, a dynamic IP address will be assigned by a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server, which is subject to change. 
Static IP address never changes, but it can be altered as part of routine network administration.
Static IP addresses are consistent, which is assigned once, that stays the same over the years. 
This type of IP also helps you procure a lot of information about a device.

## IP Address Classification Based on Operational Characteristics
### Unicast addressing
Unicast addressing is the most common concept of an IP address in the Unicast addressing method. 
It is available in both IPv4 and IPv6.
This IP address method refers to a single sender/receiver. 
It can be used for both sending and receiving the data.
In most cases, a Unicast address is associated with a single device or host, but a device or host that may have more than one unicast address.

### Broadcast addressing
Broadcasting addressing is another addressing method available in IPv4. 
It allows you to manage data to all destinations on a network with a single transmission operation.

The IP address 255.255.255.255 is mostly used for network broadcast. 
Moreover, limited directed-broadcast uses the all-ones host address with the network prefix.

IPv6 does not provide any implementation and any broadcast addressing. 
It replaces it with multicast to the specially defined all-nodes of the multicast address.

### Multicast IP addresses
Multicast IP addresses are used mainly for one-to-many communication. 
Multicast messages are mostly sent to the IP multicast group address.

In this, routers forward copies of the packet out to every interface with hosts subscribed to that specific group address. 
Only the hosts that require receiving the message will process the packets. All other hosts on that LAN will discard them.

### Anycast addressing
In anycast addressing the data, the stream is not transmitted to all receivers. 
However, just the one that the router decides is closest to the network.

This IP addressing comes as a built-in feature of IPv6. In IPv4, it is implemented by using the Border Gateway Protocol by using the shortest-path metric. 
This method is widely used for global load balancing and is also used in distributed DNS systems.
