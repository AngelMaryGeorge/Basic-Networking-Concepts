# IPv4 vs IPv6
## What is IPv4?
IPv4 is an IP version widely used to identify devices on a network using an addressing system. 
It was the first version of IP deployed for production in the ARPANET in 1983. 
It uses a 32-bit address scheme to store 2^32 addresses which is more than 4 billion addresses. 
It is considered the primary Internet Protocol and carries 94% of Internet traffic.

## What is IPv6?
IPv6 is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol. 
This new IP address version is being deployed to fulfill the need for more Internet addresses. 
It was aimed to resolve issues that are associated with IPv4. With 128-bit address space, it allows 340 undecillion unique address space. 
IPv6 is also called IPng (Internet Protocol next generation).
Internet Engineer Taskforce initiated it in early 1994. The design and development of that suite are now called IPv6.

## Features of IPv4
### Following are the features of IPv4:

Connectionless Protocol
Allow creating a simple virtual communication layer over diversified devices
It requires less memory, and ease of remembering addresses
Already supported protocol by millions of devices
Offers video libraries and conferences

## Features of IPv6
### Here are the features of IPv6:

Hierarchical addressing and routing infrastructure
Stateful and Stateless configuration
Support for quality of service (QoS)
An ideal protocol for neighboring node interaction

## What is the Difference Between IPv4 and IPv6?
IPv4 & IPv6 are both IP addresses that are binary numbers. 
IPv4 is a 32-bit binary number, and IPv6 is a 128-bit binary number address. 
IPv4 addresses are separated by periods, while IPv6 addresses are separated by colons.

Both IP addresses are used to identify machines connected to a network. In principle, they are almost similar, but they are different in how they work.

## Is IPv4 or IPv6 better?
IPv4 is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol (IP), while IPv6 is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol. 
Therefore, IPv6 is more advanced, secure, and faster compared to IPv4.
